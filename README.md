__KeyboardMouse.kt is still in an experimental stage, as such we can't guarantee API stability between releases. While
we'd love for you to try out our library, we don't recommend you use this in production just yet.__

## What is KeyboardMouse.kt

KeyboardMouse.kt is a lightweight, coroutine-based multiplatform kotlin library for idiomatically interacting with Keyboard and
Mouse (receiving and sending global events).

We aim to provide high-level as well as high-performant low-level access to such APIs. See the documentation below to
know more!
